## Happy Cybersecurity Awareness Month!

**Halt! What's the Passphrase? Web** is a browser-based passphrase generator that creates strong, memorable passphrases of exactly the length you choose (10 – 50 characters). It uses the Web Crypto API for true randomness, and lets you sprinkle in numbers or special characters. HWTP is not the usual smash‑lots‑of‑random‑words‑together-and-call-it-a-passphrase passphrase generator!

HWTP Web is based on [Halt! What's the Passphrase Python CLI on GitHub.](https://github.com/Unic0rn0ver10ad/halt-whats-the-passphrase)
